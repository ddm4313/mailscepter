# MailScepter
MailScepter is a simple tool written in Python, you can use it to send simple emails, it's very easy to use.<br>
<code> scepter = MailScepter("email", "password")</code><br><code>scepter.send_mail("sender", "recipient", "email body") </code>

That's how easy it is to run it, you ofcourse need to import the module before using it like this.<br>
<code> from mailscepter import MailScepter </code>

If you got any suggestions, do let me know.
